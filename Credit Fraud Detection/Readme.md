# Fraud detection using credit cards transaction dataset

# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. With the rise in digital payments, fraudulent activities have become a significant concern for financial institutions. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of anonymized credit card transaction records, including Time, Transaction Amount, and 28 principal components obtained via PCA (V1â€“V28). The target variable (Class) indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

# Objectives
Analyze transaction patterns to detect fraudulent behavior.
Build and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.
Compare different classification techniques (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
Optimize the model for high precision and recall to reduce financial loss.

# Workflow
- Importing Libraries and Loading File
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Balancing the dataset using SMOTE
- Train and Test set split
- Modelling
- Hyperparameter Tuning
